# Lung Capacity Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts human lung capacity using demographic and health data (age, height, smoking status, gender, caesarean birth) with various machine learning models.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Multiple regression and advanced models
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Interactive prediction for new inputs

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `Lungcapacitypred.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells.

## Project Structure
- `Lungcapacitypred.ipynb` — Main analysis and modeling notebook
- `LungCapData.csv` — Dataset (if included)
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python dependencies
- `images/` — Plots and figures
